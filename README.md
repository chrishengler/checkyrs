A command-line game of Draughts, written in C++. Built in OSX Mavericks, other OSX/*nix systems untested but should work in principle. GUI may or may not follow.

Includes AI based on Negamax algorithm. Variable depth lookahead and configurable aggression/defensiveness to come.

External dependencies: unit testing with [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), tokenizer from Boost library (developed with Boost 1.58)
