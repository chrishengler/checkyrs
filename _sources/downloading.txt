Downloading Checkyrs
********************

Checkyrs source code is made available via `a public github repository
<https://github.com/chrishengler/checkyrs>`_. It can be downloaded through
the command line:

  ``$ git clone https://github.com/chrishengler/checkyrs ./checkyrs``

Currently there is no Makefile included, but the folder structure containing
the code is very simple and compiling should not be difficult. Be aware of
the external dependencies from the Boost library.
